# Python Warrior

This is an attempt to make a game similar to [Ruby Warrior](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior/).

It won't have so great design or "art", since everything will be done by myself.

The reason I'm building this is I want to experiment with web based code interpreters. For this project I'm using [skulpt](https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt).

## TODOS:

- Use local storage for saving the content of the text editor - save button.
- Create backbone stuff.
